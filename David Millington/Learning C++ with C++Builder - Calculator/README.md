# Learn to program with C++Builder: C++ Calculator

Source code from the blog series on learning C++ with C++Builder. It's not 'learning to program' - this assumes you already have some basic programming knowledge, including object orientation, pointers, etc - but rather, 'learning to program with C++'.

The series covers installing the free Starter edition of C++Builder; cross-platform UI design; good architectural principles such as UI / logic separation, ownership, etc; introduces basic C++ syntax; introduces a number of useful concepts and classes, such as unique pointers and optional<T>; and puts all these together demonstrating their use in a simple math calculator program of the sort you might see on the iOS or Android app stores.
